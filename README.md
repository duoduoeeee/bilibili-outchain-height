# bilibili-outchain-height
missing autoheight tool for bilibili outchain player.

## What's this?

This is a small tool for you to properly and elegantly utilize the official html5 outchain player by bilibili.

As you will discover, now Bilibili's html5 player doesn't provide the function of automatically adjusting width and height of its media player, rendering it virtually unusable in production - the width and height are all default values of its parent iframe.

So here is the right tool to make Bilibili great again!

## How to use

To install, you have to put everything in this repository in your webroot. You will need an apache or nginx powered php server.

To use the tool, simply open up the `index.html` file in your browser and you will know what to do.
